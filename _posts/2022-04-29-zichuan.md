## 紫川

启国东临邙海，海中有浮根。状若孤岛，浮于海上，方圆数十里，其深不知几千丈。每逢三月有藤生于其上，皆西向，一日夜间可生长数十里，虽越海翻山而不改其向。概其若川奔流，故名紫川。五月下弦至于启都临沂，时人若破晓而不见天明，方知紫川已至，其藤蔓攀缘城墙之上，遮天蔽日，斩之不断阻之不绝。启极西有山，名曰方止，顶孕青石。紫川东来，皆汇于此，滔滔之势触青石方止，遂而花开，万万里皆共于此时。启人谓之紫川花汇，一日夜而枯。是夜沿途百城藤蔓骤消，天降花雨，乃启国男女一年一遇之私会佳节。



## The story of 紫川 (Zi-Chuan)

This story is wrote in 2015 when I was still living in Japan. I wanted to build a fantasy world with the most incredible and imaginative creatures. 紫川 (Zi-Chuan) is one of those stories that I loved most. 

It describes a kind of huge purple vines, called "紫川", that grows once a year. Every March, it will grow across the entire nation to reach a west mountain called "方止", which means The Place to Stop. When it touches the top of the mountain, the entire gigantic vines that is thousands of miles long will start to bloom all at once. The young people of the nation will then gathered under falling flowers and the huge dying vines to celebrate it as their Valentines Day.
