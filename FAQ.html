  	<h1 class="page-heading">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

	<div class='qa'>
	<p class='question'><b>Q: How can I get an update when a new post comes out?</b></p>
	<p><b>A:</b> I post about my new post on this Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/lilianweng/">@lilianweng</a> account. There is also a <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/feed.xml" target="_blank">RSS feed</a>.</p>
	</div>

	<div class='qa'>
	<p class='question'><b>Q: What tool do you use for plotting?</b></p>
	<p><b>A:</b> I'm using Google Presentation (cloud version of PowerPoint).</p>
	</div>

	<div class='qa'>
	<p class='question'><b>Q: Can I translate your posts to another language?</b></p>
	<p><b>A:</b> Yes and my pleasure! But please <a href="contact.html" target="_blank">email</a> me in advance and please keep the original post link on top (rather than in tiny font at the end, and yes I do see that case and that makes me feel sad).</p>
	</div>

	<div class='qa'>
	<p class='question'><b>Q: Do you update your old posts?</b></p>
	<p><b>A:</b> Yes, I update my old posts periodically. Everytime I would add an one-line update message in blue on top of that post, like:<br/><image src={{ '/assets/images/example-update.png' | relative_url }} style='width:75%'/>
	</p>

	<div class='qa'>
	<p class='question'><b>Q: Hmmm ... I have papers on super relevant topics but you didn't include them?</b></p>
	<p><b>A:</b> As you may know, it is pretty challenging to do a comprehensive literature review given a big topic. There are so so many papers in the wild. With Google scholar and recursive citation search, I get to see quite a lot of papers but still not all of them. You are more than welcome to shoot me an email with pointers to interesting but missing papers. Cheers!

	<div class='qa'>
	<p class='question'><b>Q: How can you keep up blogging?</b></p>
	<p><b>A:</b> "Pain is inevitable but suffering is optional" --- this is the first sentence of Haruki Murakami's book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2195464.What_I_Talk_About_When_I_Talk_About_Running" target="_blank">"What I Talk About When I Talk About Running"</a>. I love that book. His altitude towards running is pretty much aligned with how I feel about maintaining this blog.

	<p style="color: #aaaaaa; font-size: 85%;">I snack a lot while writing my blogs. Well, it is actually more like, no snack no will power. If you enjoy my posts, I wouldn't mind for 1-3 dollars donation to my <a href="https://venmo.com/lilianweng" target="_blank">venmo</a> or <a href="https://paypal.me/LilianWeng" target="_blank">paypal</a>, so I can buy more <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CAd9qnMD4Ps/" target="_blank">chips</a> :P</p>
